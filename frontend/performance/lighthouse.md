Choose the Lighthouse workflow that suits you best:

1. In Chrome DevTools. Easily audit pages that require authentication, and read your reports in a user-friendly format.
2. From the command line. Automate your Lighthouse runs via shell scripts.
3. As a Node module. Integrate Lighthouse into your continuous integration systems.
4. From a web UI. Run Lighthouse and link to reports without installing a thing.

The CLI and Node workflows require you to have an instance of Google Chrome installed on your machine.
