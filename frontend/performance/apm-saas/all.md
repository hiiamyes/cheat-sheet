newrelic vs datadog

New Relic and Datadog are both popular application performance monitoring (APM) tools, but they have some differences in their features and capabilities.

New Relic offers a range of products, including APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile app monitoring, and more. It provides real-time monitoring and diagnostics for web and mobile applications, helping you identify performance issues and troubleshoot problems quickly. New Relic also offers a dashboard with customizable widgets and charts to visualize data and metrics.

On the other hand, Datadog also provides APM, infrastructure monitoring, and other monitoring solutions. One of the key advantages of Datadog is its ability to monitor cloud environments, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. It also provides a range of integrations with other tools and services, such as Kubernetes, Docker, and more. Datadog offers customizable dashboards, alerts, and anomaly detection to help you track and analyze performance data.

Both New Relic and Datadog have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between the two largely depends on your specific needs and requirements. If you are primarily focused on monitoring web and mobile applications, then New Relic might be a good fit. If you need to monitor cloud environments and want to take advantage of a wide range of integrations, then Datadog might be a better choice.
