A sitemap is a file where you provide information about the pages, videos, and other files on your site, and the relationships between them. Search engines like Google read this file to more intelligently crawl your site. A sitemap tells Google which pages and files you think are important in your site, and also provides valuable information about these files, such as when they were last updated, how often they are changed, and any alternate language versions of a page. This helps search engines to more effectively index your site, understanding the site structure and content.

Sitemaps are the easiest way to communicate with Google. They indicate the URLs that belong to your website and when they update so that Google can easily detect new content and crawl your website more efficiently.

Even though XML Sitemaps are the most known and used ones, they can also be created via RSS or Atom, or even via Text files if you prefer maximum simplicity.

According to Google:

You might need a sitemap if:

Your site is really large. As a result, it's more likely Google web crawlers might overlook crawling some of your new or recently updated pages.
Your site has a large archive of content pages that are isolated or not well linked to each other. If your site pages don't naturally reference each other, you can list them in a sitemap to ensure that Google doesn't overlook some of your pages.
Your site is new and has few external links to it. Googlebot and other web crawlers navigate the web by following links from one page to another. As a result, Google might not discover your pages if no other sites link to them.
Your site has a lot of rich media content (video, images) or is shown in Google News. If provided, Google can take additional information from sitemaps into account for search, where appropriate.
