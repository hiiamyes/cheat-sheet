A sitemap is a file where you provide information about the pages, videos, and other files on your site, and the relationships between them. Search engines like Google read this file to more intelligently crawl your site. A sitemap tells Google which pages and files you think are important in your site, and also provides valuable information about these files, such as when they were last updated, how often they are changed, and any alternate language versions of a page. This helps search engines to more effectively index your site, understanding the site structure and content.
