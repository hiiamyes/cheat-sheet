## og:image: 1200 x 630 pixels in 5MB

When specifying the size for the og:image property in Open Graph protocol, there are no strict rules or requirements regarding the dimensions. However, it is recommended to follow certain guidelines to ensure optimal display across different platforms. Here are some general recommendations:

Aspect Ratio: Maintain an aspect ratio of 1.91:1 for the image. This means that if the width is 600 pixels, the height should be 314 pixels (600/1.91).

Minimum Resolution: Use an image with a minimum resolution of 1200 x 630 pixels. This ensures that the image is displayed clearly on high-resolution devices.

Maximum Resolution: Avoid using excessively large images that may slow down page loading. While there is no strict maximum resolution, keeping the image size below 5 MB is a good practice.

Supported Formats: Use common image formats such as JPEG or PNG. JPEG is typically preferred for photographic images, while PNG is useful for images with transparency.

Remember that different platforms or social media websites may have their own specific recommendations or requirements. Therefore, it's always a good idea to consult the documentation or guidelines provided by the platform where you intend to use the og:image property.
