## checklist
1. Semantic URLs
2. Title Tags
    - custom title tag for every single page and post. 
    - the headline that tells Google and your visitors what the page is about. 
    - creating an engaging, short sentence that describes the content of the page and utilizes one or two of your most important keywords. 
    - Google displays between 50-60 characters of the title tag in search so try and keep it around that length.

3. Meta Description
    - Displayed on the search engine results page (SERP) right below the headline (title tag).
    - Google shows between 150-160 characters in the SERP so you should keep it around that length. 
  
4. Internal Link Strategy

5. Basic Content Elements

6. Image SEO
    - Alt Tag
      - Gives search engines and other bots context for your image.
      - Don't stuff with keywords, keep the text natural and descriptive.
      - Don't use alt tags on decorative images, like background images.
    - Caption
    - Image URL and Filename
    - Image Size

7. Video SEO

8. Mobile SEO Matters

9. Sitemap
    - Sitemaps help Google and other search engines find and index your content quickly.
    - You can submit your sitemap directly to Google through Google Search Console to make sure Google finds and crawls all your pages. 
    - tip, type site:www.yourdomain.com into Google to find indexed pages
  
10. Robots.txt and Robots Meta Tags
    - For non-sensitive information, block unwanted crawling by using robots.txt
  
11. Canonical Tags and Duplicate Content

12. Preferred Domain (Google Webmaster Tools)
    - If you specify your preferred domain as http://www.example.com and we find a link to http://example.com, we'll consider both links the same. Learn more about setting a preferred domain.

Sitelinks

- We only show sitelinks for results when we think they'll be useful to the user.
- If the structure of your site doesn't allow our algorithms to find good sitelinks, or we don't think that the sitelinks for your site are relevant for the user's query, we won't show them.
- At the moment, sitelinks are automated.
- There are best practices you can follow, however, to improve the quality of your sitelinks. For example, for your site's internal links, make sure you use anchor text and alt text that's informative, compact, and avoids repetition.
