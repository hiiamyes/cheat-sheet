1. Semantic URLs
2. Title Tags
  - custom title tag for every single page and post. 
  - the headline that tells Google and your visitors what the page is about. 
  - creating an engaging, short sentence that describes the content of the page and utilizes one or two of your most important keywords. 
  - Google displays between 50-60 characters of the title tag in search so try and keep it around that length.

3. Meta Description
