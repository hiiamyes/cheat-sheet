# Event

## [Event bubbling and capture](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#Event_bubbling_and_capture)

When an event is fired on an element that has parent elements, modern browsers run two different phases â€” the capturing phase and the bubbling phase.

In the capturing phase:

- The browser checks to see if the element's outer-most ancestor (<html>) has an onclick event handler registered on it in the capturing phase, and runs it if so.
- Then it moves on to the next element inside <html> and does the same thing, then the next one, and so on until it reaches the element that was actually clicked on.

In the bubbling phase, the exact opposite occurs:

- The browser checks to see if the element that was actually clicked on has an onclick event handler registered on it in the bubbling phase, and runs it if so.
- Then it moves on to the next immediate ancestor element and does the same thing, then the next one, and so on until it reaches the <html> element.

In modern browsers, by default, all event handlers are registered in the bubbling phase.
