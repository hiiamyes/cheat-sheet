# Versioning

```
yarn versions
```

## Symbol

- [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver): The semantic versioner for npm `[major, minor, patch]`

- [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org)

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
