Github blocked that token dunno why, will investigate

Could be that you accidentally published the token in a public place that Github indexes and disabled it.

Starting today you can commit more confidently, knowing that we will email you if you push one of your OAuth Access Tokens to any public repository with a git push command. As an extra bonus, we'll also revoke your token so it can't be used to perform any unauthorized actions on your behalf.
