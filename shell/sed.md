# sed

The acronym SED stands for Stream EDitor. It is a simple yet powerful utility that parses the text and transforms it seamlessly. SED was developed during 1973â€“74 by Lee E. McMahon of Bell Labs. Today, it runs on all major operating systems.

## Basic syntax

```
sed [-n] [-e] 'command(s)' files
sed [-n] -f scriptfile files
```

- -e : Next argument is an editing command. Here, angular brackets imply mandatory parameter. By using this option, we can specify multiple commands. Let us print each line twice:

## bad flag in substitute command: '/'

```
PARTNER_PORTAL_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3003
k8s_config=$(
  cat "k8s.template.yaml" |
    sed "s/{{PARTNER_PORTAL_API_BASE_URL}}/$PARTNER_PORTAL_API_BASE_URL~g"
)
```

```
sed: 1: "s/{{PARTNER*PORTAL_API* ...": bad flag in substitute command: '/'
```

Use an alternate regex delimiter as sed allows you to use any delimiter (including control characters):

```
sed "s~$var~replace~g" $file
```
