Tests written to check software functionality can be grouped into a few categories. Some of the most popular categories include:

- unit tests: check input => output of self-contained functions.
- integration tests: check that individual pieces of your app play nicely together.
- end-to-end tests: check that entire features work from the userâ€™s perspective.
