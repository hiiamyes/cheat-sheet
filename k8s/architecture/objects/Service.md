# Service

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/

An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.

With Kubernetes you donâ€™t need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.

## [Create](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/connect-applications-service/#creating-a-service)

```
kubectl apply -f api-service.yaml
```

## Update

## Delete

```
kubectl delete -f api-service.yaml
```

## Get

## Defining a Service

```yaml
# api-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: api
spec:
  selector:
    app: api
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
```

- spec.ports.type
  - NodePorts
  - LoadBalancers
- spec.ports.targetPort
  - A Service can map any incoming port to a targetPort.
  - By default and for convenience, the targetPort is set to the same value as the port field.
