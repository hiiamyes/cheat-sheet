## The insv/insp source files in the Insta360 iPhone/iPad app local folder are stored in the app's DCIM folder. This folder is different from iPhone's photo album DCIM folder. To transfer the insv or insp files from the app's DCIM folder to your desktop, you need to use iTunes file transfer.

Connect your iPhone (or iPad) to your desktop using USB.

In iTunes select your iPhone and on the left select File Transfer.

Select the Insta360 app then select the DCIM folder within the app.

Click Save and the app's DCIM folder will be saved to your desktop.

## Reverse transfer: PC to Insta360 iPhone app:

To transfer insv files on your PC back to the iPhone app, you will again use iTunes File Transfer.

Create a folder on your desktop named `IMPORT` and copy the files you want to import into the app into it.

In iTunes, drag the IMPORT folder on the PC and drop it on the iTunes Insta360 IMPORT folder.The files will be imported into the iPhone app the next time you open the Insta360 app on your iPhone or iPad.

For those who are curious what will happen if you use the DCIM folder instead of IMPORT folder when you want to transfer files from PC to iPhone app: no file will show in the app and those files will be automatically deleted after a while

## Why? because of the post editing flow

1. upload to nas
2. import only clips needed to iphone's insta360 app

## Q

1. 用 Finder 丟檔案進 360 app 都沒 progress bar 超麻煩，都不知道有沒有在傳
