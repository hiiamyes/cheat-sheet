# GDPR cookie consent

What is GDPR cookie consent?
GDPR cookie consent is when users give their informed, explicit, unambiguous consent to which cookies on your website they will allow to be activated and collect their personal data, while visiting your site. A compliant GDPR cookie consent must be granular, i.e. users must be able to choose some cookies rather than others and not be forced to simply accept or reject all.
