- Different paradigm than imperative and object-oriented languages.
- Side-effect-free functions as a basic building block.
- Traditionally, one of the big disadvantages of functional programming was also the lack of side effects. It's very difficult to write useful software without IO, but IO is hard to implement without side effects in functions.
-     the reasons for the popularity of functional programming is mostly because of two reasons: Concurrency is getting to be a real problem in normal programming because we're getting more and more multiprocessor computers; and the languages are getting more accessible.
